# The whole file is a list of examples.  Unless otherwise indicated, examples
# are independent of each other.  For complicated examples that involve state
# that can't be established using a single HTTP request, requirements (in the
# form of other examples) can be declared.
#
# Some variable substitution is done to some of the content in this file.  The
# details of what and how are explained below but here is the list of variables
# that are globally defined and always available to be substituted:
#
# DOMAIN - The domain name of the cluster API server.

-
  # Every element must have a unique identifier.  Documentation can use these
  # identifiers to select examples to include.  Examples can also declare other
  # examples as dependencies using this identifier.
  id:
    "get version"

  # Every example has docs explaining what it is an example of.
  doc: |
    Retrieve the version of the Flocker cluster.

  # Half of the example is the HTTP request you issue to trigger some behavior.
  # The harness knows this is HTTP so it turns this pseudo-HTTP into real HTTP
  # that can be rendered into the documentation or issued against a server for
  # validation.  A User-Agent should automatically be inserted.  %(VARIABLES)s
  # in the request body get values substituted in for them.
  request: |
    GET /v1/version HTTP/1.1

  # The other half of the example is the HTTP response you'll get if you do
  # this.  Ditto about the harness translating pseudo-HTTP into real HTTP.
  # %(VARIABLES)s are substituted in the response body as well.
  response: |
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
